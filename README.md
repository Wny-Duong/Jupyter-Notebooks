# Jupyter-Notebooks
Personal repo of old jupyter notebook .ipynb files for me to reference when redoing similar work.

Please note, this is not meant to be open-source work, unless used for non-school related purposes. Some of this material came straight from doing homework for CS courses at UCLA and it is not intended for such work to be duplicated by those taking the classes I once did.
